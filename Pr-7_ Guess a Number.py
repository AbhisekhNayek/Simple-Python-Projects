'''The 1st method uses only recursion function, if, while loops but 2nd method by chat GPT use some other functions also so that it looks pretty than my code.
* I done this base upon learning of mainly on function and recursion function, means we created the some function and calling that function in last *

Project Description:
                enter a number by user if that matches with system number its correct, wrong means again user needs to guess and enter the number.
If user choose hard only 5 attempts, easy means 10 attempts.

Note:     the os.system('cls') command didn't work on Online compiler, better do in vs code and in that also need to do some setting so for that
