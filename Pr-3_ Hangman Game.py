'''The 1st method uses only if, if-else, for, while loops and random functions but 2nd method by chat GPT use some other functions also so that it looks pretty than my code.
* I done this base upon learning of mainly on While loop and Random Function *

Project Description:
Guessing a word letter by letter '''

#Method 1(Jennyâ€™s Lecture):
import random

    if letter == chose_random[j]:
      display[j]=letter
