'''The 1st method uses only recursion function, if, Dictionaries, while loops but 2nd method by chat GPT use some other functions also so that it looks pretty than my code.
* I done this base upon learning of mainly on recursion function, means we created the calculator function and calling that function in last *

Project Description:
                It is a Calculator with 2 options, 1st time we do 2 input and got 1 output with that 1 output we can make another calculation as Input 1 with new input 2, 
or make another calculation with 2 new inputs

Note:     the os.system('cls') command didn't work on Online compiler, better do in vs code and in that also need to do some setting so for that

#Method 1(Jennyâ€™s Lecture):

import OS
print("C A L C U L A T O R")
def add(a,b):
  return a+b
def subract(a,b):
  return a-b
def multiply(a,b):
  return a*b
def divide(a,b):
  return a/b

operations_dict={
  '+': add,
  '-': subract,
  '*': multiply,
  '/': divide
}
def calculator():
  number1=int(input("\n\nEnter the 1st Number: "))
  for i in operations_dict:
    print(i)
  symbol=input("\nWhich operation You are going to use: ")
  continue_flag=False
  while not continue_flag:
    number2=int(input("\nEnter the 2nd Number: "))
    calculator_function=operations_dict[symbol]
    output=calculator_function(number1,number2)
    print("\n The answer is ",output)

    anothercal=input(f"\n Press Y for calculation with {output}, press N to new Calculation, press Q to quit: ").lower()

    if anothercal == 'q':
      continue_flag= True
    if anothercal == 'y':
      number1=output
    if anothercal == 'n':
      continue_flag= True #breaking while loop and again calling function to start from scratch
      os.system('cls')
      calculator()
      
calculator()
